# Development

## Setting Up uv

This project is set up to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python and
dependencies. First, be sure you
[have uv installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Then [fork the bossjones/screencropnet_yolo
repo](https://github.com/bossjones/screencropnet_yolov11/fork) (having your own
fork will make it easier to contribute) and
[clone it](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

## Basic Developer Workflows

The `Makefile` simply offers shortcuts to `uv` commands for developer convenience.
(For clarity, GitHub Actions don't use the Makefile and just call `uv` directly.)

```shell
# First, install all dependencies and set up your virtual environment.
# This simply runs `uv sync --all-extras` to install all packages,
# including dev dependencies and optional dependencies.
make install

# Run uv sync, lint, and test:
make

# Type-check with ty (faster, in addition to basedpyright in `make lint`):
make check

# Build wheel:
make build

# Linting:
make lint

# Run tests:
make test

# Delete all the build artifacts:
make clean

# Upgrade dependencies to compatible versions:
make upgrade

# To run tests by hand:
uv run pytest   # all tests
uv run pytest -s src/module/some_file.py  # one test, showing outputs

# Build and install current dev executables, to let you use your dev copies
# as local tools:
uv tool install --editable .

# Dependency management directly with uv:
# Add a new dependency:
uv add package_name
# Add a development dependency:
uv add --dev package_name
# Update to latest compatible versions (including dependencies on git repos):
uv sync --upgrade
# Update a specific package:
uv lock --upgrade-package package_name
# Update dependencies on a package:
uv add package_name@latest

# Run a shell within the Python environment:
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

See [uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for details.

## Agent Rules

See [.cursor/rules](../.cursor/rules) for the canonical agent rules, written for
[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) but applicable to any agent.

`CLAUDE.md` (and `AGENTS.md`) are now **hand-edited and tracked in git** — they
are the source of truth for project memory. The `make agent-rules` target that
used to regenerate them from `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` is currently commented out in
the `Makefile` to avoid clobbering hand edits, and `make` / `make clean` no
longer touch those files. To regenerate from `.cursor/rules/` again, uncomment
the `agent-rules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and matching `clean` lines in the
`Makefile`.

## IDE setup

If you use VSCode or a fork like Cursor or Windsurf, you can install the following
extensions:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

- [Based Pyright](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=detachhead.basedpyright)
  for type checking. Note that this extension works with non-Microsoft VSCode forks like
  Cursor.
